		<p><b>Aviation ranking website Skytrax unveiled its annual list of the world's top 20 best airports on Wednesday, and last year's winner has been dethroned by Singapore Changi Airport.

			According to Skytrax, its results are determined via global customer satisfaction surveys of over 550 airports that rank things like food and retail options, security, terminal layout, comfort, seating, and WiFi. 
			
			The website describes the awards as a "quality benchmark for the world airport industry" and said the "survey and awards are independent of any airport control, influence or input." The questionnaires were collected from August 2022 to February 2023.
			
			"Changi Airport is honoured to be named World's Best Airport for the 12th time," Changi CEO Lee Seow Hiang said in a press release.</b></p>
